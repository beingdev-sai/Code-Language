## 📌 Project Description

This is a beginner-friendly Python mini project that performs **text encoding and decoding** using a simple character-to-code mapping technique.

The project lets the user **convert normal text into a coded format** (encryption) and then **decode it back to original text** (decryption) using predefined dictionary mappings.

This project was built as part of my Python learning journey to practice:

- Lists
- Dictionaries
- Functions
- Loops
- String Manipulation
- Conditional Statements

---

## ✅ Features

- ✅ Custom encoding of each alphabet character (a-z, A-Z, space, comma, period)
- ✅ Dictionary-based encryption and decryption
- ✅ Mode selection for Encoding or Decoding
- ✅ User-friendly CLI (Command Line Interface)
- ✅ Good for beginners to understand mapping and string handling

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- No external libraries required (uses only Python built-in features)

---

## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Clone this repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-github-username/your-repo-name.git
```

🖥️ Program Flow
On running, the program asks:

Select operation mode 
- For Code :- 1 
- For Decode :- 2
- Then enter the text string you want to encode or decode.

  
📚 Learning Outcome
Through this project I learned:

✅ How to use dictionaries for key-value mapping

✅ How to take user input and handle modes

✅ How to use loops and conditionals for string manipulation

✅ Basic idea of encoding and decoding text
